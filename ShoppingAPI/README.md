## Project Structure
Express app,
Common - the group of all reusable function.
Middleware - the group of all middlewares. It includes all common functions as a middleware.
Controller - the group of all contollers, I tried to cover try-catch for all function to prevent the unexpected server error.
Database - I used simple Json-db instead of MySQL or MongoDB to save time.
